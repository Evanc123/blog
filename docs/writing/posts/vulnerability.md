# How to be Vulnerable

This section is called "How to be vulnerable" but it's better written as "How I am vulnerable". It could be also written as, how to fear less, how to be more open. I'm not sure if I'm doing anything correctly, but I do think it is made my life a lot easier by reducing this spiritual friction that I think many of us have.

    These are just transcriptions of voice notes I've sent to myself. I don't have any plans to publish this in its current form. But I'll keep this in a PR for a journal entry.

## Healing to 101%

I think people choose for the most part to be less vulnerable because being vulnerable offers an opportunity to be hurt. One thing that I learned from people who went to marriage therapy or couples counseling was this idea that after an argument you want to make sure you return to 101% or at least 100% because if you get to a place where after every fight your relationship is 99% of what it used to be. It turns catastrophically downhill. Whereas if it goes to 100% that's pretty good. But if after conflict you can build a place where your relationship is 101% of what it used to be. You set yourself into a world where you're almost incentivized, to just resolve the conflict. And I think vulnerability is the same.

I think when you get to a place where you feel like you have the confidence to heal, vulnerability becomes a no-brainer.

You can be open unabashedly, you can take risks, you can fall in love, you can trust people, you can share the spiritual and psychic and material energy with whomever and know that if anything happens you would be okay and you would learn. If you really believed that you would always heal to 100% the reward becomes very high and the risk becomes very low because you never lose sense of who you are.

If you felt like being vulnerable with your partner or someone that you meet could result in them not liking you and being rejected and if you feared that sense of rejection then you would likely not be vulnerable.

If you feared that speaking your mind and letting know that someone is breaking your boundaries could result in them ridiculing you or berating you then again that fear is what stops you from confronting those issues.

## The world is a mirror

In my essay on advice I talk a lot about how I think the world is a mirror. And one of my conclusions from that line of reasoning was the fact that the only way for me to see myself is in the reflection of others. And so it just wouldn't make any sense if I decided to walk through life with a mask on.
